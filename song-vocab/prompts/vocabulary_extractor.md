Given these Japanese song lyrics, identify important vocabulary words and break them down into their components.

For each word:
1. Extract the full word in kanji/kana
2. Provide the romaji reading for the full word
3. Give the English translation/meaning
4. Break down each part (kanji/kana character) with its possible romaji readings

Only include words that would be valuable for Japanese language learners.
Focus on:
- Common vocabulary that appears in JLPT N5-N2 levels
- Important grammar patterns
- Culturally significant expressions
- Words with multiple kanji characters
- Adjectives and verbs in their different forms

Format each word like the following example:
{
    "kanji": "新しい",
    "romaji": "atarashii",
    "english": "new",
    "parts": [
        { "kanji": "新", "romaji": ["a","ta","ra"] },
        { "kanji": "し", "romaji": ["shi"] },
        { "kanji": "い", "romaji": ["i"] }
    ]
}
