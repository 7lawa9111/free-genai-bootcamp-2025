I'll create a detailed implementation plan for the POST route. Here's a markdown file with step-by-step instructions:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: POST /study_sessions Route

## Overview
This endpoint will create a new study session for a group with a specific study activity.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Understand the database schema for `study_sessions` table
- [ ] Review existing GET endpoints to understand the data structure

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Basic Route Setup
- [x] Add the route decorator and function:
```python
@app.route('/api/study-sessions', methods=['POST'])
@cross_origin()
def create_study_session():
    pass
```

### 2. Request Validation
- [x] Add validation for required fields:
```python
def create_study_session():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        
        # Validate required fields
        required_fields = ['group_id', 'study_activity_id']
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                return jsonify({"error": f"Missing required field: {field}"}), 400
```

### 3. Database Implementation
- [x] Add SQL insert statement:
```python
        cursor = app.db.cursor()
        
        # Insert new study session
        cursor.execute('''
            INSERT INTO study_sessions (group_id, study_activity_id, created_at)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        ''', (data['group_id'], data['study_activity_id'], datetime.utcnow()))
        
        study_session_id = cursor.lastrowid
        app.db.commit()
```

### 4. Return Response
- [x] Fetch and return the created session

### 5. Error Handling
- [x] Add error handling for database constraints

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- [x] Test with valid data:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/study-sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "group_id": 1,
    "study_activity_id": 1
  }'
```

- [x] Test with missing fields:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/study-sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "group_id": 1
  }'
```

### Unit Test Example
- [x] Add test file `test_study_sessions.py`

## Final Checklist
- [x] Code implements all required functionality
- [x] Error handling is in place
- [x] Response format matches other endpoints
- [x] Tests are passing
- [x] Code is properly formatted and commented
- [x] No console errors or warnings
```

This plan breaks down the implementation into manageable steps while providing code snippets for each part. The junior developer can follow the checkboxes to track their progress and ensure nothing is missed. The testing section provides both manual curl commands and a unit test example to verify the implementation works correctly.
